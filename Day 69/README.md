You are given the head of two singly linked lists head1 and head2 representing two non-negative integers. You have to return the head of the linked list representing the sum of these two numbers.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

Examples:

Input: 
    
Output:  1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2
Explanation: Given numbers are 123 and 999. There sum is 1122.
    
Input: 
    
Output: 7 -> 0 
Explanation: Given numbers are 63 and 7. There sum is 70.
    
Constraints:
1 ≤ Number of nodes in head1, head2 ≤ 105
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 9
