Given an array arr[] of n sorted linked lists of different sizes. Your task is to merge all these lists into a single sorted linked list and return the head of the merged list.

Examples:

Input:
   
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
Explanation: The arr[] has 3 sorted linked list of size 3, 3, 1.
1st list: 1 -> 3 -> 7
2nd list: 2 -> 4 -> 8
3rd list: 9
The merged list will be: 
    
Input:
   
Output: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8
Explanation: The arr[] has 3 sorted linked list of size 2, 1, 3.
1st list: 1 -> 3
2nd list: 8
3rd list: 4 -> 5 -> 6
The merged list will be:
