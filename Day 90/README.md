Given the root of a BST and an integer k, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the BST. If there is no kth smallest element present then return -1.

Examples:

Input: root = [20, 8, 22, 4, 12, N, N, N, N, 10, 14], k = 3
    
Output: 10
Explanation: 10 is the 3rd smallest element in the BST.
Input: root = [2, 1, 3], k = 5
    
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no 5th smallest element in the BST as the size of BST is 3.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes, k ≤ 104
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 104
