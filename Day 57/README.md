Given an integer array arr[] and a number k. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size k in the array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4
Output: [3, 4, 4, 3]
Explanation:
First window is [1, 2, 1, 3], count of distinct numbers is 3.
Second window is [2, 1, 3, 4] count of distinct numbers is 4.
Third window is [1, 3, 4, 2] count of distinct numbers is 4.
Fourth window is [3, 4, 2, 3] count of distinct numbers is 3.
Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: [2, 1]
Explanation:
First window is [4, 1], count of distinct numbers is 2.
Second window is [1, 1], count of distinct numbers is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 3
Output: [1, 1, 1]
Explanation: Every window of size 3 in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], contains only the element 1, so the number of distinct elements in each window is 1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ k ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
