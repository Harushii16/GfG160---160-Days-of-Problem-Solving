Given the root of a binary tree and an integer k, determine the number of downward-only paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals k.

Note: A path can start and end at any node within the tree but must always move downward (from parent to child).

Examples:

Input: root = [8, 4, 5, 3, 2, N, 2, 3, -2, N, 1], k = 7

Output: 3
Explanation: The following paths sum to k
 
Input: root = [1, 2, 3], k = 3

Output: 2 
Explanation: The following paths sum to k

Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 104
-100 ≤ node value ≤ 100
-109 ≤ k ≤ 109
