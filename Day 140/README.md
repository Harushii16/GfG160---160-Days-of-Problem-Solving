Given a matrix mat[][], where each cell in the matrix can have values 0, 1 or 2 which has the following meaning:
0 : Empty cell
1 : Cell have fresh oranges
2 : Cell have rotten oranges

Your task is to determine the minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten. A rotten orange at index (i, j) can rot other fresh orange at indexes (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1) (up, down, left and right) in a unit time.

Note: If it is impossible to rot every orange then simply return -1.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[2, 1, 0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 1, 2, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Oranges at positions (0,0), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3) will rot adjacent fresh oranges in successive time frames.
All fresh oranges become rotten after 2 units of time.
Input: mat[][] = [[2, 1, 0, 2, 1], [0, 0, 1, 2, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2, 1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: Oranges at positions (0,0), (0,3), (1,3), and (2,3) rot some fresh oranges,
but the fresh orange at (2,0) can never be reached, so not all oranges can rot.
Constraints:
1 ≤ mat.size() ≤ 500
1 ≤ mat[0].size() ≤ 500
mat[i][j] = {0, 1, 2}
