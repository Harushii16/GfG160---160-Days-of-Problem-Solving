Serialize and deserialize a binary tree

You are given the root of a binary tree. You have to perform Serialization and Deserialization. Serialization is to store a tree in an array so that it can be later restored and deserialization is reading tree back from the array. Complete the functions:

serialize() : stores the tree into an array and returns the array.
deSerialize() : deserializes the array to the tree and returns the root of the tree.
Note: Multiple nodes can have the same data and the node values are always positive integers. Your code will be correct if the tree returned by deSerialize(serialize(input_tree)) is same as the input tree. Driver code will print the level order traversal of the tree returned by deSerialize(serialize(input_tree)).

Examples :

Input: root = [1, 2, 3]       

Output: [1, 2, 3]
Input: root = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60, N, N] 

Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 60]
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 104
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 109
