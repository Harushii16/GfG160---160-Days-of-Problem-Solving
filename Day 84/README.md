Given two arrays representing the inorder and preorder traversals of a binary tree, your task is to construct the binary tree and return its root.

Note: The inorder and preorder traversals contain unique values, and every value present in the preorder traversal is also found in the inorder traversal.

Examples:

Input: inorder[] = [3, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2], preorder[] = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5]
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Explanation: The tree will look like

Input: inorder[] = [2, 5, 4, 1, 3], preorder[] = [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 4, 3, 5, N, N, N, 2]
Explanation: The tree will look like

Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 103
0 ≤ nodes -> data ≤ 103
Both the inorder and preorder arrays contain unique values.
