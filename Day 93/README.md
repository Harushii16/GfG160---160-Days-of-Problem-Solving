Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (with all values unique) and two nodes n1 and n2 (n1 != n2). You may assume that both nodes exist in the tree. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of the given two nodes in the BST.

Note: LCA between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the deepest node that has both n1 and n2 as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

Examples:

Input: root = [5, 4, 6, 3, N, N, 7, N, N, N, 8], n1->data = 7, n2->data = 8
      
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is the lowest node that has both 7 and 8 as descendants.
Input: root = [20, 8, 22, 4, 12, N, N, N, N, 10, 14], n1->data = 8, n2->data = 14
           
Output: 8
Explanation: 8 is the lowest node that has both 8 and 14 as descendants.
Input: root = [2, 1, 3], n1->data = 1, n2->data = 3
        
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 is the lowest node that has both 1 and 3 as descendants.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 105
1 ≤ n1->data, n2->data ≤ 105
